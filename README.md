# Udacity Finding Donor Projects

This repo is based on the first project of Data Scientist Nanodegree of Udacity with tensorflow. Although, I have already been a machine learning engineer in my past, I am not as skilled in tensorflow specifically, previously I have worked in pytorch, etc. And, it is important to work with basics and understand most popular framewworks.  This repo also includes other notebooks pertaining to excercises from the section that culminated in the donors project. 


In this project, I will employ several supervised learning algorithms to accurately model individuals’ income using the data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. The dataset originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article “Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid”. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi online.

The Main goal of the project is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. Understanding an individual’s income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.

The dataset and project itself is small and quite simple, but it allows for a throughtful introduction to machine learning with tensorflow.

### Models 

In this project I explore three basic ML models. 

Adaboost 
DecisionTree
SVC. 

### Conclusion 

This was a fun and simple project. I achieved the goal on the first try and provided a final model with adaboost. The notebook and EDA work is listed above.
